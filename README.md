# BayesDDQN
This repository contains the code for the paper "A Reinforcement Learning based Framework for Holistic Energy Optimization of Sustainable Cloud Data Centers".

In this work, we propose an energy-efficient framework based on reinforcement learning, where a new joint prediction method named MTL-LSTM is implemented to improve the accuracy of energy consumption and thermal status estimates within the state space, and a novel energy-aware approach named BayesDDQN is designed to avoid IT and cooling resourcesâ€™ asynchronous allocations in the action space, thereby optimizing the energy consumption.
